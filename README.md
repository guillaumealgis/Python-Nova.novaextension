Full featured Python Language Server Plugin (implements [PyLs](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server)) for Nova, supports Jedi Autocomplete, PyFlakes, PyLint, YAPF, Rope, McCabe, PyDoc and CodeStyles.

Also supports all the Python Language Server plugins â†’ `mypy`, `isort` and `black`

## Installation

1. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip3 install 'python-language-server[all]'
```

2. Enable required modules from settings.

3. (Optional) Install Python Language Server plugins and enable them from settings:

## Working

- All Features that PyLS supports.
- Snippet fills are broken because of a Nova [Bug](https://github.com/mmshivesh/PyLS-Nova.novaextension/issues/1) in v1.2
